# FuneralWatcher

Funeral Watcher is a library to read images, later maybe videocapture and check these images for provided textual patterns.
An example UseCase is an automatic deathcounter for challanginge souls like Videogames like... yeah DarkSouls ofc.

The used technologies will be CV (OpenCV, EMGU) and OCR (Tesseract). In the first its just a static image that should be scanned, after this a repeating screenshot of the important screenarea is planned. And in the end, the screen could be captured direclty with CV.
